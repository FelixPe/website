# Limitations

- the following ShEx features are not implemented yet:
    - structural schema validations on schema creation time
    - imports
    - external shapes
    - annotations
    - semantic actions
- only the [datatypes supported by RDF.ex](https://rdf-elixir.dev/rdf-ex/literals.html#typed-literals) are supported in datatype and numeric facet constraints (more supported datatypes are the next planned feature for RDF.ex)
- greedy
- non-ascii characters in regular expression are not fully supported yet
