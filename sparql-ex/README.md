# Introduction

SPARQL.ex is an implementation of the [SPARQL](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) standards for Elixir.

It allows to execute SPARQL queries against [RDF.ex](/rdf-ex) data structures. With the separate [SPARQL.Client](/sparql-client) package SPARQL queries can be executed against SPARQL protocol endpoints.
